Install  
-------  
```bash  
   # !!! Before start, I'm not a professional linux developer. I wrote this applet and it works perfect on my ubuntu budgie (ubuntu 17:10, budgie version: 10.4,  device: acer aspire 5745g) . Please take your own risks and backups before install. Have fun!

   # Clone or download the repository
   git clone https://github.com/serdarsen/UBrightnessController.git
   
   # Go to the UBrightnessController directory (first)
   cd UBrightnessController

   # Execute the install script.
   ./install.sh
   
   # You can add U Brightness Controller to your panel from Budgie Desktop Settings.

```
