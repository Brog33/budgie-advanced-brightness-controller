Usage  
-------  
```bash  
   # !!! Before start, I'm not a professional linux developer. I wrote this applet and it works perfect on my ubuntu budgie (ubuntu 17:10, budgie version: 10.4,  device: acer aspire 5745g) . Please take your own risks and backups before install. Have fun!

   # Go to the budgie plugins directory in terminal or in tilix.
   cd /usr/lib/budgie-desktop/plugins
   
   # Clone UBrightnessController (/usr/lib/budgie-desktop/plugins/UBrightnessController).
   sudo git clone https://github.com/serdarsen/UBrightnessController.git
   
   # Restart ubuntu. Run following code or restart normally.
   sudo reboot

   # After restart you can add U Brightness Controller to your panel from Budgie Desktop Settings.

```
